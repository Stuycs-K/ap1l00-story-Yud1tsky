Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no chicken nuggets
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on Twitter, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the Titanic. It is a way I have of driving off the
chocolate and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the telephone;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my bazooka; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin party, and bringing up the rear of every goose I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the sun, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's chicken nuggets off—then, I account it high time to get to balloons as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all ghosts in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
